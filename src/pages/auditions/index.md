      The next step of your audition is sight reading.  You will receive a link
      to sign up for either August 4th or August 9th. On these days, at 11:00
      am, a short sight reading example will be emailed to you, and you will
      have exactly 2 hours to record a video of yourself singing the example a
      capella, post it to YouTube as Unlisted, and submit the link to a form
      that will be included in the email. If you have a conflict with both of
      these times, please email Caroline Boyt (mboyt@clemson.edu) AFTER July
      30th to discuss other options.
