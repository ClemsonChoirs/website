Thank you for your interest in Clemson Choirs! Each of our choral ensembles are open to ALL students at Clemson University. 

Auditions for CU Singers (MUSC 3700) and Cantorei (MUSC 3450) will be held in-person in Brooks 119 by appointment. Email Dr. Bernarducci (bernar5@clemson.edu) to set up an audition time. You will be asked to sing the first verse of "My Country Tis of Thee" and will be given a short sight-reading exercise. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

If you would like to be a part of Men's Choir (MUSC 3720) or Womenâ€™s Choir (MUSC 3710), no audition is necessary! Simply register for the class on iRoar. 

For more information on Tigeroar and TakeNote auditions contact Dr. David Conley.
