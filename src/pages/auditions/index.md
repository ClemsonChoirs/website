Thank you for your interest in Clemson Choirs! Each of our choral ensembles are open to ALL students at Clemson University. 

Auditions for CU Singers (MUSC 3700) and Cantorei (MUSC 3450) for the Fall 2022 Semester will be announced later this Spring.

If you would like to be a part of Men's Choir (MUSC 3720) or Womenâ€™s Choir (MUSC 3710), no audition is necessary! Simply register for the class on iRoar. 

For more information on Tigeroar and TakeNote auditions contact Dr. David Conley.
