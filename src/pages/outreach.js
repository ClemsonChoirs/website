                        <p>Each year the Clemson Choral Department in partnership with the Brooks Center for the Performing Arts selects a high school choral program for a year long artistic collaboration. This program has three goals: to build relationships with performing arts programs in the upstate area, offer instruction and performance opportunities, and provide various ways for students to engage in the rich concert season presented at the Brooks Center each year.</p>
                        <p>Selected schools will benefit from the following:</p>
                        <ul>

In addition, a handful of choirs attending will receive a masterclass with Dr. Bernarducci on the Brooks Center stage upon request. This concert and clinic is at no cost to the schools. We look forward to sharing a day of choral music together!</p>
