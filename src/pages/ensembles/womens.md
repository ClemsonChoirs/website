**Women’s Choir (MUSC 3710) is a non-auditioned all-female ensemble from any major. To participate, register for the course and attend the first rehearsal on the first Thursday of each semester at 2:00 p.m.**

The Clemson University Women’s Choir consists of about 45 undergraduate students. The ladies represent almost every major Clemson University offers, but are united by a passion for vocal music. Women’s Choir meets twice a week, learning a multitude of pieces from varying genres of choral literature.
