**Men's Choir (MUSC 3720) is a non-auditioned, all-male ensemble consisting of approximately 65 students from any major.**

Begun in 1896, Men's Choir is the oldest musical organization at Clemson University. This choir performs a wide variety of traditional choral literature representing multiple genres, style periods, and nationalities. No audition is required and students from all majors are encouraged to join.
