      Prospective voice students should prepare two art songs or folk songs of
      contrasting styles. At least one of the selections MUST be in a language
      other than English. Make sure the selections adequately demonstrate
      musicality, tone quality, and technical abilities.

      In addition to the prepared pieces, students will be asked to sight read a
      short excerpt.

      For repertoire suggestions, please contact: Dr. Anthony Bernarducci at
      bernar5@clemson.edu.

      I attended Clemson from Fall 2008 to Spring 2012. One of the biggest
      benefits of this degree for me was the size of the department. Because of
      the smaller class sizes, I felt more included in the department. The
      camaraderie between the disciplines was enjoyable and led me to have a
      varied experience with opportunities exploring theatre and audio
      technology on top of music. I currently am an adjunct professor at Francis
      Marion University where I teach music appreciation as well as voice
      lessons. I also run a private vocal studio in Hartsville, SC, and am the
      contemporary music director for a local church.

      I attended Clemson from Fall 2005 to Spring 2009. My favorite part of the
      degree—and perhaps of my college experience in general!—was participating
      in Clemson Choirs. I looked forward to every rehearsal, as it was always a
      highlight of my day and a much-needed respite from the stress of academic
      life. There is nothing like singing and making music with your peers. I
      made some of my very best friends in Clemson Choirs, many of whom I still
      keep up with to this day! After college, I moved to New York City and
      pursued a career in Arts Administration. I spent 5 years in the
      Development department at Carnegie Hall, where I worked in foundation
      relations, corporate sponsorships, and individual giving. As Senior
      Manager of the Patron Program, I helped raise more than $10 million
      annually to fund more than 100 concerts per year, as well as extensive
      music education programs.
