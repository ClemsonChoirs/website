      Prospective voice students should prepare two art songs or folk songs of
      contrasting styles. At least one of the selections MUST be in a language
      other than English. Make sure the selections adequately demonstrate
      musicality, tone quality, and technical abilities.

      In addition to the prepared pieces, students will be asked to sight read a
      short excerpt.

      For repertoire suggestions, please contact: Dr. Anthony Bernarducci at
      bernar5@clemson.edu.

      I attended Clemson from Fall 2008 to Spring 2012. One of the biggest
      benefits of this degree for me was the size of the department. Because of
      the smaller class sizes, I felt more included in the department. The
      camaraderie between the disciplines was enjoyable and led me to have a
      varied experience with opportunities exploring theatre and audio
      technology on top of music. I currently am an adjunct professor at Francis
      Marion University where I teach music appreciation as well as voice
      lessons. I also run a private vocal studio in Hartsville, SC, and am the
      contemporary music director for a local church.
