      Prospective voice students should prepare two art songs or folk songs of
      contrasting styles. At least one of the selections MUST be in a language
      other than English. Make sure the selections adequately demonstrate
      musicality, tone quality, and technical abilities.

      In addition to the prepared pieces, students will be asked to sight read a
      short excerpt.

      For repertoire suggestions, please contact: Dr. Anthony Bernarducci at
      bernar5@clemson.edu.

    date: Graduated Spring 2019
    description: >-
      I was a part of the Clemson Choirs during my entire five years at Clemson,
      2014-2019. Throughout that time, I had the opportunity to be a member of
      CU Singers, Men's Choir, Cantorei, and Tigeroar. My favorite memory would
      absolutely be the CU Singers tour to Germany and the Czech Republic in the
      summer of 2017. It was such an amazing trip with so many of my best
      friends, and there was just something unique and special about that trip
      that I will never forget.


      I now live in Austin, Texas, and am a graduate student in Music Education
      at the University of Texas at Austin. I also serve as a graduate teaching
      assistant for the UT band program, and hope to be a high school or college
      band director one day.

    date: Graduated Spring 2010
    description: >-
      I was at Clemson from 2006-2010 as a Performing Arts Major. I was a member
      of Clemson Choirs all four years, singing with Women’s Glee and CU
      Singers. 

      I am currently the Associate Choral Director at Dorman High School in
      Spartanburg County. I also have a private lesson studio of students
      studying voice, guitar, and songwriting. When I am not teaching, I am a
      singer-songwriter performing regularly at venues around the upstate. My
      music can be found on Apple Music, Spotify, and my website:
