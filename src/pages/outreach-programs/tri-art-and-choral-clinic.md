Each year the Clemson Choral Program hosts a concert on the Eskridge Tri-Art Series at the Brooks Center for the Performing Arts. In addition, a handful of choirs attending will recieve a masterclass with Dr. Bernarducci on the Brooks Center stage upon reqest. This concert and clinic is at no cost to the schools. We look forward to sharing a day of choral music together!
