Each year the Clemson Choral Program hosts a concert on the Eskridge Tri-Art Series at the Brooks Center for the Performing Arts. In addition, a handful of choirs attending will receive a masterclass with Dr. Bernarducci on the Brooks Center stage upon request. This concert and clinic is at no cost to the schools. We look forward to sharing a day of choral music together!

If you have questions concerning reservations or seating availability, please contact Tri-ART Coordinator Nancy Martin at nmartin@clemson.edu or by phone at 864-656-7787 for more information.
